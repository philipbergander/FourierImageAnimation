# FourierImageAnimation
Animation of images using Fourier series

Inspired by 3Blue1Brown's animations of Fourier series: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6sGWTCMz2k&t=1247s

The code works as follows:
Reads a png file with a drawing which is made from a continuous line a pixel wide.
The code interprets this line as a function in the complex plane.
The complex Fourier series' coefficients are calculated.
The coefficients are used to calculate each phasor's magnitude and angular speed.
